# Burger Voice Ordering: Action Plan & Strategy

## Overview

**Burger** is a newly-formed startup building a **voice-controlled ordering system** for fast-food chains (e.g. drive-thru or self-service kiosks). Our goal is to enable customers in the US/UK (initially) to place orders conversationally with an AI agent, entirely on the **edge (offline)** for reliability. We have **two seasoned engineers** on the team and plan to utilize only **open-source (permissive license) components** ‚Äì ensuring no vendor lock-in or costly licenses. Key requirements include:

* **On-Device Processing:** All speech recognition (ASR), language understanding, and speech synthesis (TTS) should run on a local single-board computer (SBC) at the kiosk (e.g. NVIDIA Jetson Orin or Raspberry Pi 5). This guarantees the system works even if internet connectivity is lost.
* **High Accuracy & Low Latency:** The voice assistant must handle **noisy environments** (drive-thru background noise, various accents) and respond quickly in real-time.
* **Open-Source Stack (MIT/Apache License):** We avoid proprietary frameworks like NVIDIA Riva (which requires a special license and enterprise agreement) and instead choose free alternatives.
* **Multi-Language Ready:** The initial deployment will be English, but the architecture should allow adding other languages (e.g. Spanish, French) with minimal changes. This means choosing models and frameworks that support multilingual capabilities or can be extended easily.
* **Seamless User Experience:** The system will interact via **voice and a display** ‚Äì it should show the running order on a screen (just as human-driven drive-thrus do) and confirm the final order. It must handle natural dialogue (e.g. adding items, removing ingredients like ‚Äúno cheese‚Äù, suggesting add-ons like drinks, and final confirmation).

We will leverage experience from related projects (e.g. our **Madellang** real-time voice translation platform) to inform Burger‚Äôs design. In particular, Madellang demonstrated effective use of **local AI models** (Whisper, Vosk, Coqui TTS) with low latency streaming via WebSockets and a simple web-based UI. We plan to adapt that architecture ‚Äì focusing it on the fast-food ordering domain.

## Open-Source Tech Stack Selection

We have identified a stack of **100% open-source** tools (MIT or Apache licensed) for each component of the voice ordering system. Below is a summary of the chosen stack:

| Component                 | Open-Source Solution                                        | License             | Rationale                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **ASR (Speech ‚Üí Text)**   | *OpenAI Whisper* (English model) <br> *Vosk* (Alpha Cephei) | MIT <br> Apache 2.0 | Whisper for high accuracy; Vosk for lightweight offline use.                         |
| **NLU + Dialog**          | *Rasa Open Source*                                          | Apache 2.0          | Full conversational AI framework (intent classification + dialogue management).      |
| **TTS (Text ‚Üí Speech)**   | *Coqui TTS*                                                 | MIT (MPL-2.0) ‚úÖ     | Natural-sounding speech synthesis; deployable locally for low latency.               |
| **Backend Orchestration** | *FastAPI* (Python) + WebSockets                             | MIT                 | Coordinate ASR‚ÜíNLU‚ÜíTTS pipeline; real-time streaming architecture.                   |
| **Device Hardware**       | *NVIDIA Jetson* (Orin NX) <br> *Raspberry Pi 5*             | n/a (hardware)      | Jetson: GPU acceleration for heavy models. Pi 5: low-cost option for smaller models. |

üîç **Why these choices?**

* **Speech Recognition (ASR):** We will start by evaluating two leading open ASR engines: **Whisper** and **Vosk**. **OpenAI‚Äôs Whisper** (MIT licensed) is known for **near-human accuracy** on clean English speech and strong noise robustness and accent tolerance. It supports 99 languages and was trained on 680k hours of data, making it state-of-the-art in accuracy. However, Whisper‚Äôs larger models are resource-intensive (requiring a GPU and more memory) and have higher latency, which might be challenging for real-time use on an SBC (Whisper ‚Äúlarge‚Äù definitely won‚Äôt run on a Pi, but smaller Whisper models might). **Alpha Cephei‚Äôs Vosk** (Apache 2.0) is a lightweight alternative optimized for offline realtime use ‚Äì **models \~50 MB** can run on modest hardware (even Raspberry Pi) and support **20+ languages**. Vosk offers a streaming API and can recognize speech with low latency on CPU, making it ideal for edge devices. The trade-off is accuracy: Vosk‚Äôs small models have higher word error rates (\~10%+ on clean speech) and are less robust to heavy noise as compared to Whisper. To balance this, Vosk allows **dynamic vocabulary customization** (we can bias recognition towards menu item words to improve accuracy). Our plan is to use **Whisper** (English-medium or small model) on a GPU-enabled device (Jetson) for maximum accuracy, and have **Vosk** as a fallback or as the primary ASR on lower-end hardware (like Pi 5) where Whisper might be too slow. Both engines run offline, satisfying our privacy and reliability needs. We will benchmark both on actual **drive-thru audio** to decide the default engine. (In early prototypes, community tests show even a Raspberry Pi 5 can handle Whisper‚Äôs tiny model in real-time with \~5s latency for 10s of speech, so there is potential to use Whisper on ARM with the right optimizations.)

* **Natural Language Understanding (NLU) & Dialogue:** For interpreting the transcribed text and managing the conversation flow, we choose **Rasa Open Source**. Rasa is an **open-source conversational AI framework** (Apache 2.0) that includes both an NLU component (for intent classification and entity extraction from text) and a dialogue management component (to handle multi-turn conversation logic). This fits our needs perfectly: we can train Rasa‚Äôs NLU on our **food ordering intents** (e.g. Intent: ‚ÄúPlaceOrder‚Äù, ‚ÄúAddItem‚Äù, ‚ÄúRemoveItem‚Äù, ‚ÄúConfirmOrder‚Äù, ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù) and define entities such as menu items, sizes, toppings/modifiers, quantity, etc. For example, if the user says ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like a **Big Mac with no pickles** and a **large Coke**,‚Äù Rasa can extract **item=Big Mac**, **modifier=no pickles**, **drink=Coke (size=large)** from the text. The dialogue manager in Rasa lets us create rules or stories for the conversation: e.g. after an initial order intent, the assistant should ask ‚ÄúAnything else?‚Äù; if the user is done, it should proceed to confirmation; if an item is not understood, it can ask for clarification. Rasa‚Äôs framework is robust and has been used in many production chatbots, and it‚Äôs completely free for commercial use. Another benefit is that Rasa can run locally (it‚Äôs just a Python process) and we have full control to customize or extend it. We will build a **custom Rasa domain** for fast-food ordering, including a small **knowledge base** of menu items so the assistant can recognize them and perhaps even answer simple questions (like ingredient queries if needed in the future). Using Rasa means we don‚Äôt have to reinvent NLP algorithms from scratch ‚Äì we leverage its ML models (which we can train on example phrases) for understanding the orders.

* **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** To give the system a voice, we will use **Coqui TTS** (an open-source deep-learning toolkit for TTS, originally forked from Mozilla‚Äôs project). Coqui TTS is **MIT-licensed** (the code under MPL-2.0, which permits commercial use) and has a library of pre-trained models for many languages and voices. It‚Äôs capable of producing very **natural-sounding speech** and even supports **custom voice cloning** with small samples. For our MVP, we can start with an existing English voice model (for example, a pleasant female voice that sounds friendly and clear over a speaker). Coqui TTS can run on the edge ‚Äì either using the CPU or accelerated with the GPU ‚Äì ensuring **low-latency responses** without requiring cloud services. This is important because we want the assistant‚Äôs voice to start speaking almost immediately after the user finishes their sentence. Coqui‚Äôs toolkit includes efficient models (like FastPitch + a WaveGAN or similar vocoder) that can generate speech quickly (the latest version even supports <200ms latency streaming synthesis as noted in their updates). We will need to ensure the chosen voice is intelligible over a drive-thru speaker (which may have limited audio quality), so we might test a couple of voices for clarity. In the future, if the client (fast-food chain) wants a custom ‚Äúbrand voice‚Äù, we could use Coqui‚Äôs voice cloning to create a unique voice font ‚Äì for now, an off-the-shelf model will do.

* **Backend and Integration:** The glue of the system will be a **backend service** (written in Python, likely using **FastAPI** or Flask for simplicity) that ties everything together. The backend will handle **audio input/output streaming** and orchestrate the pipeline:

  1. Receive audio from the microphone (we can use a WebSocket or similar streaming endpoint to continuously send audio frames from the kiosk device‚Äôs frontend). This is how our Madellang project achieved real-time audio handling ‚Äì FastAPI can easily support a `/ws` endpoint for audio.
  2. Pass the audio to the ASR engine (Whisper or Vosk) to get interim and final transcripts. If using Vosk, we can get streaming partial results via its API; if using Whisper, we might run it in chunks or use a Whisper variant that supports streaming. Voice Activity Detection (VAD) can be employed to determine end-of-speech.
  3. Once text is finalized for a user utterance, feed it to Rasa to parse intent and entities.
  4. Decide the next response based on dialogue state (the Rasa policy or a simple rules engine will decide, e.g., if intent is OrderFood, the system might reply with a follow-up question or confirmation).
  5. Generate the reply text (for example, ‚ÄúOkay, one Big Mac without pickles. Would you like to add a drink or dessert?‚Äù).
  6. Send this text to the TTS engine (Coqui) to produce audio, and play the audio through the speaker for the customer.
  7. Simultaneously, update the on-screen display: show the recognized order items and the spoken prompt. For instance, as the user orders, the screen could list ‚Äú1x Big Mac (no pickles)‚Äù so far, and the assistant‚Äôs question ‚ÄúWould you like a drink?‚Äù can also appear as text. This dual modality (voice + screen) improves clarity and user confidence, akin to how drive-thru order confirmation boards function today.

  We will develop a simple **frontend UI** (potentially a React web app, similar to Madellang‚Äôs frontend) that runs on the kiosk tablet/touchscreen. This UI will handle capturing microphone input (with user permission or a push-to-talk button) and displaying the conversation text. It can communicate with the backend via WebSocket for audio and via REST or WebSocket for receiving the assistant‚Äôs responses. The reason to use a web-based UI is flexibility and rapid development (plus our team has experience with React from earlier projects); however, for an embedded kiosk, a native app or just hooking into existing kiosk software could also be considered. Initially, a web UI is fine for demo purposes.

* **Hardware Considerations:** We are weighing **NVIDIA Jetson vs. Raspberry Pi 5** for the edge device. The **NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX** (or Xavier) offers a powerful GPU (with Tensor Cores) that can accelerate our deep learning models ‚Äì this would allow us to run larger Whisper models or faster TTS. NVIDIA also provides tools like TensorRT that could optimize model inference. Jetson would make real-time transcription with Whisper more feasible and could potentially even run medium-sized models. On the other hand, the **Raspberry Pi 5** is much cheaper and more power-efficient, with a decent CPU (Quad-core Cortex-A76 at \~2.4GHz) and a modest GPU. Community tests indicate a Pi 5 can handle Whisper **tiny.en** model with roughly 2x real-time speed (5s processing for 10s of speech), and possibly the base or small models with some delay. Vosk small models run very well on Pi (since they only need \~300MB RAM and use CPU). If we target one device per kiosk, the cost difference is important: a Jetson Orin might cost a few hundred dollars vs Pi‚Äôs \~\$60. We might prototype on both to see which meets the performance requirements. It‚Äôs possible we use Jetson for drive-thru units (where noise is higher and accuracy must be top-notch) and could use Pi for indoor kiosks (quieter environment). We‚Äôll also attach a high-quality **microphone array** to the device ‚Äì e.g. a USB mic array like Seeed‚Äôs ReSpeaker. A directional or noise-cancelling mic setup is crucial because microphone input quality dramatically impacts ASR accuracy. We can include a foam windscreen or enclosure to reduce wind noise for outdoor drive-thru use. The speaker output will use the existing kiosk speaker system; we just need to ensure our audio volume and clarity is tuned for that system.

With this stack, we fulfill the requirement that everything is **open-source and on-premise**. Notably, **no cloud APIs are required**, so we incur **no usage costs** and minimize privacy concerns (all voice data stays on the device). Each component‚Äôs license (MIT/Apache/MPL) permits commercial use without royalties, which is ideal for a startup product.

## System Architecture and Workflow

Before diving into the timeline, it‚Äôs helpful to visualize how the pieces work together in the Burger system:

„ÄêDiagram not available„Äë *The voice ordering system pipeline:* **(1)** The customer speaks into the kiosk‚Äôs microphone. **(2)** The audio stream is sent to the on-device server (FastAPI) which passes it through the **ASR engine** (Whisper/Vosk). **(3)** The recognized text is fed into the **NLU/Dialogue Manager (Rasa)**, which maintains the state of the conversation (e.g. current order, next question to ask). It decides the appropriate response. **(4)** The response text (e.g. ‚ÄúWould you like to add fries?‚Äù or confirmation of the order) is sent to the **TTS engine (Coqui)** to synthesize speech audio. **(5)** The audio is played through the speaker for the customer, and simultaneously the text of the assistant‚Äôs response and an updated order summary are displayed on the screen. **(6)** This loop continues until the order is complete and confirmed, upon which the system might instruct the customer to proceed to payment/pick-up. Finally, the order details are sent to the restaurant‚Äôs POS system or kitchen display as a normal order would.

This architecture ensures a smooth, real-time interaction. We will implement streaming where possible ‚Äì for instance, with Whisper, we might not get fully streaming results, but we can cut the audio into small chunks (e.g. 1-2 seconds) to get incremental transcriptions, or use Vosk‚Äôs streaming API to get partial words as the person is speaking. In practice, the user often speaks a sentence or two (a chunk of 5-10 seconds) for their order, so a short processing delay (a second or two) after they finish is acceptable, but we want to avoid long pauses. The use of WebSockets for audio will facilitate overlap: we can start processing the audio while the user is still speaking, and similarly, prepare TTS output while perhaps simultaneously updating the screen. Our prior project Madellang involved **bidirectional streaming** (speaking and listening simultaneously); for Burger, we will likely enforce a turn-taking (half-duplex) conversation (to mimic the push-to-talk style of a drive-thru: the system listens, then speaks). Even so, the low-latency pipeline is important to keep the interaction snappy.

## Action Plan and Roadmap

Now we outline a step-by-step **action plan** to develop and launch the Burger voice ordering system. This plan is divided into phases, each with specific goals and deliverables:

**1. Phase 1 ‚Äì Prototype Development (Weeks 1‚Äì4):**
*Objective:* Build a basic end-to-end voice ordering demo on a development machine.

* **Set up the Development Environment:** Prepare our hardware and dev environment. We‚Äôll start coding on a PC or a Jetson developer kit for convenience. Install FastAPI, Rasa (plus spaCy or any language model it needs), the chosen ASR libraries (Whisper‚Äôs PyTorch package and/or Vosk‚Äôs Python API), and Coqui TTS. Ensure each component runs in isolation (e.g., test transcribing a sample audio with Whisper, test Rasa intent parsing on sample text, generate a TTS audio from sample text).
* **Basic ASR Integration:** Write a simple script to capture audio from the microphone (or use a sample WAV) and run it through the ASR model. For rapid progress, start with Vosk (since it‚Äôs straightforward to get partial results via its API). Verify that we can get text from speech with acceptable accuracy for simple phrases. Then experiment with Whisper (using an English-only small model) to compare transcription quality. No need for streaming yet; we can initially do one complete utterance at a time.
* **NLU/Dialogue Setup:** Define a minimal Rasa **domain** for ordering. Write a few **intents** like `order_food` and `affirm`/`deny` and create a few example sentences for each to train the Rasa NLU. For instance: ‚ÄúI want a cheeseburger‚Äù ‚Üí intent: order\_food, entities: item=cheeseburger. ‚ÄúNo ketchup please‚Äù ‚Üí intent: order\_food (or modify\_order), entity: modifier=no ketchup. ‚ÄúYes that‚Äôs all‚Äù ‚Üí intent: affirm (meaning order is finished). It‚Äôs okay if initially we handle only a limited script. Train Rasa on these examples. Also, define a simple **story** or rule in Rasa: e.g., on intent `order_food`, the assistant should reply with something like ‚ÄúGot it. Anything else?‚Äù; on intent `affirm` (after an order), the assistant should proceed to confirmation. This will be rudimentary but enough to test flow.
* **TTS Integration:** Choose a default TTS model (for example, Coqui has an English female voice pretrained model available). Write a function that takes text and produces a WAV or plays audio. Ensure this works on the dev machine.
* **Connect the Pipeline:** Develop a simple **FastAPI backend** that exposes (a) an endpoint to receive audio (initially maybe just a blocking HTTP endpoint for a WAV file, or a WebSocket for streaming audio), and (b) returns the assistant‚Äôs reply. For the prototype, we can simplify by not doing true streaming: e.g., record a full sentence audio then send to backend, backend processes and responds with text + audio. Integrate ASR -> Rasa -> TTS in sequence within this backend. Hard-code some logic for conversation or use Rasa‚Äôs response if configured. The output should be the synthesized speech.
* **Prototype Demo:** By end of Week 4, we aim to have a demo where **a user can speak a simple order and the system responds with speech.** For example, user says ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like a burger‚Äù into the mic, the system (after a short delay) speaks back ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd like a burger. Would you like anything to drink?‚Äù This will prove our stack integration. We‚Äôll likely test this on a laptop/Jetson with a USB microphone and speakers.

**2. Phase 2 ‚Äì MVP Build-out (Weeks 5‚Äì12):**
*Objective:* Expand the prototype into a **minimum viable product** that can handle a realistic ordering scenario at a drive-thru, with robust performance.

* **Full Menu Support:** Work with a sample menu (we can take a typical fast-food menu of burgers, fries, drinks, etc.). Expand the Rasa NLU training data to cover various item names and ways customers might say them. This includes synonyms (‚Äúsoda‚Äù vs ‚Äúpop‚Äù vs ‚ÄúCoke‚Äù), combo meal names, sizes (small/medium/large), and modifiers (‚Äúwith no onions‚Äù, ‚Äúextra cheese‚Äù, ‚Äúmeal with coke instead of fries‚Äù, etc.). Leverage Rasa‚Äôs entity extraction for menu items and perhaps use **Lookup Tables** feature ‚Äì e.g., provide a list of all item names as possible entities to help NLU. We‚Äôll likely need a few dozen example sentences to train Rasa well. We also implement NLU for **‚ÄúYes/No** (affirm/deny) and numbers (if quantity or combo numbers are spoken).
* **Dialogue Flow & Context Management:** Develop the dialogue manager to handle multi-turn ordering. For example: user‚Äôs first order item ‚Üí assistant asks ‚ÄúAnything else?‚Äù repeatedly until user says no more. If a user says something like ‚ÄúActually, make that two cokes‚Äù in the middle, the system should understand this as modifying the order (this might be advanced, possibly treat it as another intent ‚Äúchange\_quantity‚Äù). We also script the **upsell prompt**: e.g., if no drink was ordered, the assistant can ask ‚ÄúWould you like a drink with your meal?‚Äù (as mentioned in the initial conversation plan). Rasa Rules can implement this (e.g. if intent is `order_food` and item category is a main dish and no drink in current order, trigger a follow-up action to ask about drinks). We need to be careful to not annoy the user with too many questions ‚Äì likely one upsell prompt is enough. Also ensure the assistant listens if the user spontaneously adds something without being asked (the user might answer the upsell or might ignore and say a dessert ‚Äì both should be handled gracefully).
* **UI/Frontend Development:** Create a simple **web front-end** suitable for a kiosk. This will be a single-page application showing perhaps the menu or just a blank screen with an order list. Important UI elements: a text area to display **transcribed speech** (what the system thinks the user said) ‚Äì this provides transparency, and an area to display the **current order summary** (items and their modifiers). Also display the assistant‚Äôs responses as text (like captions) while it speaks, e.g., *Assistant: "Would you like to add a drink?"*. If possible, include a visual indicator (like a **mic icon that lights up**) when the system is listening, and maybe a simple beep sound to prompt the user (similar to virtual assistants). The UI should connect to the backend: send audio via WebSocket continuously while user is speaking, and receive in return the assistant‚Äôs reply (which could be audio or text or both). We might also allow a **‚ÄúPush to Talk‚Äù** mode ‚Äì e.g., the user presses a button on the touch screen or a physical button, speaks, then releases. This might simplify VAD and turn-taking. We‚Äôll experiment with what‚Äôs more natural: open mic vs push-to-talk. (In many drive-thrus, there‚Äôs an open mic once the session starts, but the employee controls when to talk ‚Äì we might simulate that by having the system do auto VAD and barge-in prevention).
* **Edge Deployment & Performance Tuning:** By mid-phase, deploy the MVP on the target hardware. For instance, set up a **Jetson Xavier/Orin** with our software in Docker containers (we‚Äôll likely create Docker images for the final deploy, to easily drop onto devices). Measure latency of ASR and TTS. If Whisper is too slow, consider using Whisper‚Äôs smaller model or switching to Vosk for faster but slightly less accurate results. We will also test **audio preprocessing**: integrating a noise suppression like **RNNoise** before ASR. Given drive-thru noise (engines, wind, road), a denoiser can substantially improve ASR input. (Research indicates even top ASR models can see WER jump to 15‚Äì25% in noisy conditions, and that traditional offline models like Vosk struggle with background noise, so this step is important). We‚Äôll incorporate RNNoise (or a similar ML noise cancellation model) in the audio pipeline to filter out noise in real-time.
* **Menu Knowledge & ASR Biasing:** Implement a mechanism to boost recognition of menu terminology. For Vosk, we can use its **dynamic vocabulary** feature to add menu item phrases so it better recognizes them. For Whisper, which doesn‚Äôt allow custom vocabulary injection, we might handle common ASR mistakes through post-processing (e.g., if Whisper outputs ‚Äúbig mac with no pickles‚Äù as ‚Äúbig matt with no pickles‚Äù, we could correct ‚Äúbig matt‚Äù‚Üí‚ÄúBig Mac‚Äù via a dictionary of known items). Another approach is to fine-tune a smaller ASR model on in-domain data later, but for MVP we use heuristic fixes.
* **Conversation Fail-safes:** Program some basic error handling: if the ASR result is very uncertain or the NLU confidence is low, the system should politely reprompt or clarify (‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, could you repeat that?‚Äù or ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt catch that, did you want the Big Mac or something else?‚Äù). Rasa can detect low confidence intents and trigger a fallback policy. We will configure this to avoid the system acting on a misheard order without confirmation.
* **Internal Testing:** Throughout this phase, test the MVP with **simulated orders**. Each team member should try ordering in different styles: list multiple items in one sentence, use casual language (‚ÄúCan I get a uh‚Ä¶ large fries and um actually make that two.‚Äù), use different accents or speaking speeds. We will gather transcripts and see where it fails. This will help refine the Rasa training (add utterances that weren‚Äôt understood) and tweak ASR settings. By the end of Phase 2, we expect the system to handle a **complete ordering session** reliably: e.g., *Customer:* ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like a pizza margherita without cheese.‚Äù ‚Üí *Assistant:* ‚ÄúOkay, one margherita pizza with no cheese. Would you like to add a drink?‚Äù ‚Üí *Customer:* ‚ÄúSure, a large cola.‚Äù ‚Üí *Assistant:* ‚ÄúGot it. So that‚Äôs a margherita pizza (no cheese) and one large cola. Is your order on the screen correct?‚Äù ‚Üí *Customer:* ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù ‚Üí *Assistant:* ‚ÄúGreat, your total is \$X. Please drive to the window.‚Äù. We will have the screen display each item as it‚Äôs added, and the final confirmation. Achieving this end-to-end flow means we have an MVP ready for real-world tryouts.

**3. Phase 3 ‚Äì Pilot Testing (Weeks 13‚Äì20):**
*Objective:* Test the MVP in a realistic environment, iterate and improve for robustness.

* **Controlled Environment Pilot:** Set up the system in a controlled environment that mimics a drive-thru. For example, we can place the device in an office with a speaker and mic, and have people order from another room or using a two-way radio to simulate distance and noise. Even better, if we have access to a parking lot or a drive-thru window (perhaps a friendly local restaurant after hours), test with a car ‚Äì background noise from car engines and outdoor ambiance will be the real challenge. We‚Äôll have various people (colleagues, friends) act as customers.
* **Data Collection:** During pilot runs, log all interactions: audio recordings (if allowed), transcriptions, recognized intents, and whether the outcome was correct. This data is gold for analysis. We‚Äôll identify common failure modes, such as: particular words always mis-recognized, certain accent causing issues, overlapping speech (customer speaks while assistant speaking), etc. Also note timing: how long does a typical order take with our system vs a human order taker? The goal is to be as fast or faster. If we find the system lags, we might shorten some of the assistant‚Äôs phrases or otherwise streamline the flow.
* **User Feedback:** If possible, gather feedback from test users. Were the voice and prompts clear? Did they feel comfortable or was it frustrating when it misheard? This subjective input will guide UI/UX tweaks (maybe we need to add a ‚ÄúCancel/Start over‚Äù voice command or button if things go wrong, etc.).
* **Iteration:** With pilot data, improve the system:

  * **ASR:** If we see specific weaknesses (e.g., engine noise causing dropouts), consider microphone adjustments or additional noise filtering. If using Whisper and it‚Äôs too slow, try quantizing the model or using a smaller model to speed up. If accuracy on menu items is an issue, consider training a custom speech recognizer on our collected audio (this might be beyond Phase 3 timeline, but keep in mind). We might also experiment with NVIDIA‚Äôs TensorRT optimization for Whisper on Jetson to gain speed.
  * **NLU:** Augment Rasa training examples with any unseen utterances from the pilot. Fine-tune entity extraction if some items weren‚Äôt recognized correctly in text (maybe add those words to ASR vocab or Rasa synonyms list). Ensure Rasa‚Äôs dialogue stories cover any new flows encountered (e.g., if someone said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it, thanks‚Äù to end order ‚Äì we add that as an end-of-order trigger).
  * **TTS:** Check that the voice‚Äôs pronunciation of menu items is correct (sometimes TTS might mispronounce proprietary names). Coqui TTS allows us to adjust pronunciations via phoneme dictionaries if needed. Also adjust the speech rate and volume for the noisy environment ‚Äì we might increase volume or choose a slightly slower speech rate to be better understood over the outdoor speaker.
  * **Latency and Stability:** Profile where any delays are. Perhaps add multi-threading or async processing in the backend (FastAPI can handle async calls ‚Äì e.g., do TTS generation in parallel with sending data to screen). Ensure the system is stable over long periods (run it for hours in a loop to see if memory leaks or crashes occur). Implement a simple watchdog or auto-restart mechanism just in case (since this will be an unattended kiosk, it should recover gracefully from any glitch).
* **Success Criteria:** By end of this phase, we expect the system to handle a **variety of orders without human intervention** with a high success rate. ‚ÄúSuccess‚Äù means the order on the screen matches what the customer intended, and the customer didn‚Äôt have to repeat themselves more than maybe once for clarification. We also aim for speed: ideally, ordering via the voice AI should be **as fast as a human order-taker** (maybe around 40-60 seconds for a full drive-thru order). If we hit these metrics, we‚Äôll be ready to discuss deploying in a real restaurant for beta testing. If not, we‚Äôll iterate further until we do.

**4. Phase 4 ‚Äì Refinement, Production Deployment (Weeks 20+):**
*Objective:* Prepare the product for deployment at scale, consider additional features and maintenance.

* **Multilingual Extension:** With a stable English system, begin adding **multi-language support** as needed (for markets or customer bases with Spanish, etc.). Thanks to our design, this is feasible: Vosk models for many languages are available (e.g. Spanish model \~40MB), and Whisper can inherently transcribe many languages. We would configure the system either to auto-detect language (Whisper can detect language ID from speech) or to have a language selection. For NLU, we can either train separate Rasa models per language (translating our intents and entity data to Spanish, for instance) or use a translation layer (e.g., use Whisper to transcribe Spanish speech to Spanish text, then translate Spanish text to English and feed to English Rasa ‚Äì but that adds complexity and latency). A more direct approach is training Rasa on Spanish examples for the same intents. Coqui TTS also supports Spanish with pretrained voices. We‚Äôd ensure the architecture can route to the appropriate ASR/TTS model based on chosen language. Starting with bilingual (English/Spanish) could be a competitive advantage in e.g. parts of the US.

* **Edge Deployment & Scaling:** Work on containerizing or creating an image for the entire stack so it can be easily deployed to multiple kiosks. Likely use Docker or similar. We‚Äôll also implement **remote management** capabilities: since devices will be distributed, we want to be able to push updates (new models or software updates) and monitor health (CPU usage, etc.). We might set up a central server that devices periodically connect to for updates or logs (without relying on continuous internet for operations).

* **Integration with Restaurant Systems:** Develop the integration to the restaurant‚Äôs existing ordering system. The voice kiosk should ultimately output the confirmed order to the POS system so it appears as an order ticket. This could be via an API or even by emulating a button press sequence if needed. Early on, we might not fully integrate, instead just display the final order to an attendant who can manually confirm it ‚Äì but for a real product we‚Äôd automate it. We‚Äôll work with the vendor‚Äôs technical team on this integration.

* **Beta Deployment:** Identify one or two pilot restaurant locations to install Burger voice kiosks for real customer use. Provide training to staff about how the system works and what to do if something goes wrong (e.g., a fallback procedure: if the system fails to understand after 2 attempts, staff can press a button to take over the microphone). Gather real customer interactions data and refine further. This beta test will guide final adjustments before scaling up.

* **Ongoing Improvement:** Establish a feedback loop ‚Äì all deployed systems could log anonymized transcripts and usage stats to our server when connectivity is available. We‚Äôll use this to continuously improve our ASR and NLU models (for example, retrain models on real audio data to get better with regional accents or new slang). Over time, the system should get more accurate. We will also remain up-to-date with the open-source community: new versions of Whisper or Vosk, new TTS models, etc., and incorporate upgrades that could enhance performance (for instance, OpenAI might release a Whisper v2 or ‚ÄúWhisper turbo‚Äù that runs faster). Because we control the entire stack, we can swap components as technology advances.

## Exploring Innovative Approaches

While the above plan uses a **classical pipeline (ASR ‚Üí NLU ‚Üí TTS)**, we are also keen to explore **new approaches** that could differentiate our solution and improve performance:

* **End-to-End ‚ÄúSound-to-Meaning‚Äù Models:** In the future, we could reduce the complexity of the pipeline by using end-to-end neural models that go directly from speech audio to semantic output (intent or even structured order data). This is the approach that **Apprente** took ‚Äì their AI skipped intermediate text transcription and inferred meaning directly, which they touted as being more robust in noisy, conversational settings. An open-source example of this concept would be training a speech model to directly predict an ‚Äúorder vector‚Äù or command. We might leverage frameworks like NVIDIA NeMo or SpeechBrain to train a custom end-to-end model on drive-thru audio (once we have a sizable dataset from pilot deployments). This approach could potentially handle accents and slurred speech better, and be faster, since it doesn‚Äôt have to output every word ‚Äì it just needs to output the intent and parameters. However, it‚Äôs a research-intensive path. We will monitor academic progress here; if promising, Burger could eventually incorporate a specialized end-to-end ASR specifically tuned for fast-food ordering that outperforms general models.

* **Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for NLU:** Instead of (or in addition to) the intent/entity paradigm, we could use a small on-edge **language model** (like Llama 2 7B, distilled or quantized) to parse and manage conversation in a more free-form way. For instance, an LLM could take the transcribed text and directly output a parsed order or a natural language response, possibly handling unexpected inputs more gracefully. Given the resource constraints, this might be challenging on today‚Äôs SBC hardware ‚Äì but as models get optimized or if we use an NPU accelerator, it could be feasible. A hybrid approach could be: use Rasa for known structured interactions, but fall back to an LLM when the user says something out-of-script (like asking a question about ingredients or nutrition that we didn‚Äôt plan for). This can enhance the system‚Äôs capability to handle **edge cases**. We‚Äôd need to ensure any LLM used is local (for privacy) and ideally open-source. Projects like GPT4All or llama.cpp show it‚Äôs possible to run smaller LMs on edge devices with quantization. This is a longer-term exploration to keep on our radar.

* **Contextual Vocabulary and Menu Awareness:** We mentioned using dynamic vocabulary for ASR ‚Äì this concept can be expanded. The system can be **menu-aware** in real time. For example, if the menu changes for breakfast vs lunch, we can load a different set of items into the ASR‚Äôs vocabulary at different times of day (ensuring it recognizes ‚ÄúEgg McMuffin‚Äù in the morning, and doesn‚Äôt confuse it with ‚ÄúBig Mac‚Äù which isn‚Äôt offered at breakfast in some places). Similarly, if a customer is halfway through an order, the system knows what‚Äôs already ordered ‚Äì perhaps we can have the assistant be smart about upselling relevant items (if you ordered a burger, suggest fries; if you ordered a coffee, maybe suggest a pastry). This requires a bit of business logic tied to the menu database. While not purely an AI problem, it‚Äôs an *integration of AI with context* that can make the dialogue feel more natural and helpful (similar to McDonald‚Äôs own Dynamic Yield system that changes suggestions based on time/weather). We will propose features like a **recommendation module** that can be configured by the restaurant (e.g., always ask about the promotional item of the month).

* **Advanced Noise Handling:** Fast-food drive-thrus are acoustically challenging (engine rumble, wind, people might be far from the mic). We‚Äôve planned basic noise suppression, but we could take it further. One approach is using a **microphone array with beamforming** to focus on the speaker‚Äôs voice. Another is leveraging **pre-trained noise-resistant models** or training our ASR on noisy data. We could also consider a secondary **hotword detection** or **speaker separation** ‚Äì for example, if people in the car talk among themselves, the system should ideally ignore anything not directed at it. Innovative solutions here might involve a classification model to detect if the speech is directed to the system (similar to wake-word detection). We might research applying **deep noise cancellation models** or even **audio-event classification** to filter out non-speech or irrelevant sounds. Since open-source projects exist in this domain (like Mozilla‚Äôs RNNoise for noise removal, which we plan to use), we‚Äôll keep improving our front-end audio processing. This is a key differentiator ‚Äì robust performance in real noisy environments will make or break the product.

* **User Experience & Trust:** Introducing AI ordering can be odd for some customers. We should implement features to improve UX, such as **visual feedback**. For example, live transcription on screen gives customers confidence that ‚Äúthe machine heard me right‚Äù ‚Äì this transparency is crucial if we expect them to trust the system. We will ensure the text updates live as the person speaks (even if imperfect) and then corrects to the final recognized text. Another idea is a **progress indicator** or a polite chime that signals when it‚Äôs the machine‚Äôs turn vs. the customer‚Äôs turn (to avoid talking over each other). These small touches will make the interaction smoother. As we gather usage data, we might find spots to inject some personality ‚Äì e.g., a quick greeting or sign-off phrase that‚Äôs friendly. But we must also be mindful to keep interactions **efficient**; most drive-thru customers want speed more than chit-chat. We‚Äôll experiment with the assistant‚Äôs verbosity (concise confirmations vs. more chatty) to see what yields better outcomes.

* **Fallback to Human Operator:** No AI will be 100% perfect. Especially in early deployments, there may be cases where the system gets confused (e.g., heavy accent, or an off-menu request). To handle this, we propose a **seamless fallback mechanism** to a human. For instance, if the AI fails to understand after two attempts, it could automatically signal a human order-taker (maybe through a silent alarm inside or routing the audio to a remote support center). The transition should be smooth ‚Äì perhaps the system says, ‚ÄúOne moment, connecting you to an assistant.‚Äù This way the customer isn‚Äôt stuck. From an engineering POV, this means we‚Äôd have a way to either allow a human to listen in and take over the conversation via a headset, or have the system handoff the session entirely. In the short term, for pilot, it might simply alert the on-site staff to intervene at the drive-thru. In the long term, one human could potentially monitor multiple AI kiosks and intervene only when necessary (in a call center style setup) ‚Äì improving efficiency while ensuring a safety net. This ‚Äúhuman in the loop‚Äù approach is something we should design for early (it can be as simple as a manual override button on the kiosk attendant‚Äôs side). It will increase acceptance by restaurant operators who worry about AI failures, and ensure no customer is left frustrated.

* **Continuous Learning (Edge-Cloud Hybrid):** While our solution runs entirely on the edge for inference, we can use the cloud for improving the system. We‚Äôll implement a pipeline to send anonymized data (transcripts, maybe audio snippets) to our servers when the device is connected, to retrain models. This could even be an automated process: e.g., every night the device uploads data, our system retrains or fine-tunes the language model (ASR or NLU) to better fit the day‚Äôs observed language, and updates a model file. Then the device downloads the updated model in off-hours. This way, the more the system is used, the smarter it gets ‚Äì learning new slang or adapting to a regional dialect over time. Open-source tools allow us to do this securely (ensuring personal data is not stored; mainly these are orders which are not very sensitive compared to say medical data). We can also aggregate data from all kiosks to improve the global model. This continuous improvement cycle is a big advantage of owning the stack (no black-box vendor models). We should plan the infrastructure for this (cloud storage, model training pipeline, versioning) as we move towards production.

In summary, our **action plan** gets us from concept to a functioning product through iterative development, testing, and refinement. We‚Äôve chosen an open-source, on-edge approach for very deliberate reasons ‚Äì cost, privacy, control ‚Äì and our research into projects like Madellang and others in this space backs this direction. By combining high-accuracy ASR (Whisper/Vosk), a proven NLU/dialogue system (Rasa), and natural TTS on capable edge hardware, we believe we can deliver a **smooth, fast, and reliable voice ordering experience**.

## Conclusion

The **Burger voice ordering machine** has the potential to streamline fast-food drive-thrus and kiosks, bringing faster service and consistent accuracy (an AI won‚Äôt mishear because of accent or get impatient during a complex order ‚Äì and it never ‚Äúsounds tired or annoyed‚Äù, a point even Apprente highlighted as a benefit of AI). Our roadmap covers the core development from a simple prototype to a robust, multilingual system ready for deployment. We‚Äôve grounded our plan in **open-source technologies** that give us full freedom to customize and improve. This avoids the pitfalls of proprietary systems ‚Äì for example, unlike NVIDIA‚Äôs closed Riva toolkit, our solution will have **no licensing hurdles** and no dependence on external servers or third-party APIs. Everything from the voice recognition to the speech synthesis will run on a self-contained unit at the restaurant, which is a **huge advantage in reliability and data privacy**.

By following this plan, within a few months we should have a working system to pilot in a real restaurant. From there, it‚Äôs about polishing the system (with the innovative ideas mentioned: end-to-end models, better noise handling, etc.) and proving the business value ‚Äì faster drive-thru times, increased order sizes (through intelligent upselling), and perhaps labor cost savings or reallocation of staff to food prep. We will measure these in pilot tests.

Ultimately, the success of Burger will come from both **technical excellence and user experience focus**. We will continue to iterate on both fronts ‚Äì leveraging the latest research and our own data to improve accuracy, and paying attention to customer/staff feedback to refine the interaction. With our experience from similar voice-AI projects and the strong open-source community backing these tools, we are well-equipped to build an innovative solution that could be the future of fast-food ordering. üöÄ
